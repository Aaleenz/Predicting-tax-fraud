# Predicting Tax Fraud through Regression Analysis
# Overview
This project involves developing predictive models to identify potential tax fraud and property price predictions using regression analysis and decision trees. The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model implementation, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

# Features
## Data Preprocessing: 
Handling missing values, outlier detection and replacement, data normalization, and encoding categorical variables.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualization of data distributions, correlations, and trends.
## Feature Engineering: 
Converting area measurements to a standard unit, creating new features like price per square meter, and extracting temporal features.
## Regression Analysis: 
Implementing and fine-tuning a linear regression model to predict property prices.
## Decision Tree Classification: 
Developing a decision tree classifier to predict tax fraud risk.
## Model Evaluation: 
Using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and classification reports.
